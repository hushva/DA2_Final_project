The original data was collected from Kaggle.com webpage, downloaded as .csv files.

The raw folder contains the two .csv files: IMDb_movies and movies_initial. The main file which contains the imdb rating variable is in the latter.
The other table has potential additional variables I considered using in the analysis.
The clean folder has one file only, the merged and cleaned movies dataset.
The variables.xlsx contains the variables' description of the cleaned dataset (excluding the later added variable - ucratio).
